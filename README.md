## Gaze Vector Prediction
* The goal of this project is to explore the limitations of webcam eye tracking and understand the methods that can be used to process webcam images into gaze vectors, which can then be used to map the gaze to a screen using calibration.

## Files
* ModelExploration.ipynb - This file contains all exploration of each of the models as well as exporing the Unity Eyes dataset.
* Report.pdf - Shows results/methods and a discussion. 

## Results
I compared three models based on performance and training time, check out Report.pdf to see more.
